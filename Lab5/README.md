Part 1: Designed an 8-bit counter using T flip flops.

Part 2: Designed a rate divider that can count at four frequencies: 50 MHz, 4 Hz, 2Hz, and 1 Hz, and display on the 7-segment HEX display.

Part 3: Designed a morse code encoder using a LUT, a shift register, and a rate divider. The encoder used 0.5-second pulses to represent dots, and 1.5-second pulses to represent dashes. The encoder can respresent letters S-Z.
