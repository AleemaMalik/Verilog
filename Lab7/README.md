Part 1: Designed a memory module consisting of a memory block, address register, data register and a control register.

Part 2: Designed a circuit that accepted an X, and Y location, and a colour, and would then draw a 4x4 pixel square whose upper-left corner is at the (X,Y) location specified by the input.

Part 3: Designed a simple animation using the box from Part 2 to bounce around the screen. The color of the box can be changed anytime.
